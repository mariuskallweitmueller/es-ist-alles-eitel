#### In George Orwellʼs Nineteen Eigthy-Four, the protagonist is a government employee in a totalitarian state. His job is to delete references from the media of people that have been arrested or killed, by rewriting news artivles and altering photographs. 

Orwellʼs dystopia became a reality in the Soviet Union in the 1940s, wherein deleting people from images and official records happend on a regular basis to enemies of the state.

Retouching photographs to remove people has not only been done by totalitarian regimes, but what makes these cases poignant is that the deleted persons in these examples had personal relations with the leaders that ordered to have them erased from history.

**The Gangʼs Not There**

After Maoʼs death in 1976, a memorial ceremony at Tinanmen square was held. In the official photography four Chinese Communist Part officials were removed, known as the Gang of Four, one of whom was Maoʼs wife. They were arrested one month after Maoʼs death when a power struggle erupted in the communist party. <sup>(Farid, Hany, Digital Image Forensics, Dartmouth College, 2012.)</sup>

As head of the communist party internal affairs, Yezhov oversaw arrests and executions through falsifying evidence. When Yezhov himself fell out of Stalinʼs favour in 1940, he was executed and removed from archives.

**Kimʼs Uncle**
The second most powerful man in North Korea, Jang Song-Thaek, was found guilty of treason in 2013. Not only was he one of Kim Jong-unʼs closest advisors, he was also his uncle. He was abruptly accused of counter-revolutionary activities and executed.

The images are stills from the state documentary ʻThe Great Comradeʼ. The \[...\] images aired after his execution, and Jang Song-Thaek (circled in red) vanished by cropping and retouching.
