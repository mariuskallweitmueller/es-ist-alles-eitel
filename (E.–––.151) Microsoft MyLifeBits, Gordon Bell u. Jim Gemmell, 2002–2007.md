[...] Apart from official documents like his passport, he will post everything from letters and photos to home videos and work documents. All his email is automatically saved on the system, as is anything he reads or buys online. He has also started recording phone conversations and meetings to store as audio files. The privacy and corporate security risks are clear.
&nbsp;
Of course the system takes up a huge amount of memory. But Bell’s group calculates that within five years, a 1000-gigabyte hard drive will cost less than $300 – and that is enough to store four hours of video every day for a year.
&nbsp;
Each media file saved in MyLifeBits can be tagged with a written or spoken commentary and linked to other files. Spoken annotations are also converted into text, so the speech is searchable, too.

To recall a period in his past, Bell just types in the dates he is interested in. MyLifeBits then calls up a timeline of phone and email conversations, things he has read and any images he recorded.

The system can also be used to build narratives involving other people, events or places. Searching for the name of a friend would bring together a chronological set of files describing when you both did things together, for instance. [...]

Someday in the future, a compulsive recorder could call up a single day in her life and get an hour-by-hour breakdown of what she did, said and saw.
&nbsp;
To test the application, Bell is downloading his own life onto a hard drive at the MS media lab. His database spans more than a century of data: the first entry consists of photographs of his parents taken as children in 1900 and the last entry (as of Thursday morning) was a website he browsed before he was interviewed for this article. (A technical glitch kept him from recording the interview itself.)
&nbsp;
Inspired by Vannevar Bush, an engineer who in 1945 posited the creation of a "configurable storehouse of knowledge," Bell started scanning material in 1999. He has amassed more than 10 gigabits -- or 7,000 floppies -- of information. Some of it is available on his website.
&nbsp;
"My massive regret is that I don't have everything," said Bell, who has tossed the hard copies of almost all of his paper documents. [...]

<b>[...] When did you start actually start capturing your life in this way?</b>
I started this in 1998. I had all this material, and was even moving around with boxes of stuff, some of it going back to Digital Equipment days, and I thought, I'm going to start capturing it. Jim humored me, and we ended up with all this material, and we thought, this is starting to get interesting, and this is something that people should naturally do in their life.
&nbsp;
<b>Why?</b>
I think it's more natural now because so much of the material originates with a file or it comes to you electronically. I think people are naturally sort of squirrels--whether that's information or thing squirrels. At one point I thought, I want to get rid of everything.  
I want to melt down the gold medals and that sort of thing. I want my life in a bunch of bits.
&nbsp;
<b> [...] When do you turn this thing off?</b>
When do you turn off the browser and say, gee, I've been visiting a lot of porn sites and I probably don't want that in there? (Laughs.) It's true, a lot of our guys are a little bit queasy now, thinking every time we open a file, that's going to be in there, too.
&nbsp;
<b>On the BARC Web site you write, "The technical challenge is ensuring that this information will be readable by future devices." How are you going about this?</b>
We're not really addressing it seriously enough at this time. For now what I'm doing is putting a small number of what I hope are going to be golden standards. Right now I'm depending on HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) as being there. Also on .doc being there--(Microsoft) Word. But I feel that HTML is better because there's so much Web page material out there. TIFF is a nice format because it's such a low-level format, and one can imagine that it will always be readable. So a small number of formats.

What I don't depend on is Money 2003, Intuit 2003--anything that has its weird own database that I don't think will be readable over time. So I try to reduce that down to something I expect will be readable. [...]

REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Gordon Bell has spent the past five years scanning books, posters and family photos as old as 100 years into his computer. He has converted compact discs and phone conversations into computer files. In fact, many of the memories from his 68-year-old life have been turned into digitized form that collectively take up only 20 gigabytes of memory — what you'd find on the hard drive of a standard personal computer. This does not depress Bell. Instead, it gives the San Francisco-based researcher for Microsoft hope that his vision for storing, searching and retrieving any memory from one's life is coming closer to reality. [...]

[...] Key-cord Memory Sticks and mini-MP3 players have become fashion accessories in Asia, storing up to a gigabyte of content and allowing consumers to wear their entire "digital life files" around their necks, according to the website.
&nbsp;
Microsoft is working on life caching technology from both ends, capturing the everyday and storing it long-term. The company's SenseCam prototype is a badge-sized camera billed as a black box for humans.
&nbsp;
Attuned to changes in light, motion or temperature, the tiny camera takes a photo of each new setting the wearer enters. Up to 2000 images can be downloaded at day's end.
&nbsp;
The ultimate memory aid, SenseCam is being tested on Alzheimer's patients in the UK and is part of Microsoft's MyLifeBits project, run by US researcher Gordon Bell. [...]

[...] <b>Indeed, MyLifeBits</b> is really the culmination of a 2700-year historical trend. Ever since the Greeks took the Iliad out of the singsong voices of traveling balladeers and set it down on clay tablets, the world’s troves of recorded information have swelled relentlessly. Not surprisingly, humankind’s strategy has been to rely less and less on actually remembering, and more and more on being able to find something when we need it. The Gospels, Gutenberg, and Google have all been steps along the way. [...]

##### **su vida en bits, La Crónica de Hoy**
Ante tal avalancha de información, bien vale preguntarse cómo se distingue después lo importante de lo trivial. Bell afirma que la relevancia “depende de uno mismo y del contexto de lo que está guardado, ya que en algún punto, todo puede ser relevante o útil para algo”. — ¿Cómo cambió su vida desde que encaró MyLifeBits? — Siento que me ofrece una forma de “descargar” mi memoria, porque lo recuerda todo. Puedo decir que me hace sentir más libre y a la vez más responsable.

[...] “I’m a big fan of forgetting,” says Frank Nack, a German computer scientist who published a critique of lifelogging experiments last winter. “It’s how we make sense of life, how we interpret things. Everybody is building a life story; we all need to forget certain stages. I don’t want to be reminded of everything I said.” Forgetting, he points out, is key to cultural concepts like forgiveness and nostalgia. Sure, we lose track of most of what happens to us–but that natural filtering process results in what we call knowledge and wisdom. When memories are only a click away, Nack says, they’re cheapened. Without the difficult act of pulling something from the crannies of the mind, we become like the hapless high-school student who gets 2 million hits for a search on “World War II” and has no way of prioritizing them.

##### [...]And just how much data is needed on a day-to-day basis?
&nbsp;
##### "All the bits that we can that will likely have value for our memory in the near and long-term future, a few bits just for the hell of it," Bell says. "We end up with more bits because we need them for relationships."
&nbsp;
##### Still, is recalling every single detail of an entire lifetime too much? How can anyone guess what's going to be important 20 years from now?
&nbsp;
##### "It is impossible to know what will be required in the future," says Bell. "Furthermore, recording everything allows one item to be used to find another item that may have been created at the same time."
&nbsp;
##### Bell says MyLifeBits could have another important benefit: It may actually improve your real memory.
&nbsp;
##### According to Bell, being reminded of someone in a photograph or screensaver strengthens our recollections.
&nbsp;
##### We constantly are reminded of other events when we delve into our past to find snippets for which we are looking. This reinforces a whole host of links to other memories we otherwise may have forgotten. [...]
&nbsp;
##### We rely on our hard drives for saving our music, photographs, e-mails and videos — so perhaps life-logging software and memory prosthetics are simply the next stage in the evolution of our relationship to the computer.
