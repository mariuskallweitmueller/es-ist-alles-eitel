**HELP!** <span style="padding-left: 397px;">(New Haven, 2006-present)</span>
&nbsp;
My god, you think <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> need help? You’re not the one sitting in his room in New Haven, Connecticut, right now, wondering what the hell happened to your life. You’re not the one working six shifts a week at Infinite Copy and living in a dark room with wall-to-wall carpet infected by someone’s former cat. You’re not the one who is afraid to contact anyone you knew, before, because you are guilty of such terrible things that, on the one hand, no one who knows you are guilty will speak to you, and, on the other, no one who doesn’t know you are guilty will even believe you. You aren’t the one who can’t go to Canada. You aren’t the one for whom the gates of San Francisco—and don’t bother telling me that the city has no gates; I know!—have closed. You aren’t the one who can’t sleep, the one who goes out night after night into New Haven, hoping to be the victim of a violent crime, because when you lived here in 1988-91, New Haven was the seventh-poorest city in America, and abounded in violent crime of all sorts, shootings in particular, three students at Bleak College were shot in this city when you—<span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> you, I mean—lived here last, two undergraduates and a math Ph.D., anyway, you aren’t the one who walks up and down Elm Street hoping to be shot, shot, or hit by a car, vehicular homicides were also popular, you seem to remember, anyway, you, you, <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> aren’t the one who goes out at night only to find that New Haven is changed, and that the danger has disappeared from it, you aren’t the one walking past the shuttered Ann Taylor shop at three in the morning, sitting on a bench outside the shuttered Au Bon Pain, walking sacrificially past the shuttered Limited Express, waiting for an end that isn’t coming, and knowing that the end is not coming, and staring, finally, through the metal lattice at the clothes in the Limited Express window, and thinking that you might look all right in a gray turtleneck, and then remembering that you are not in the market for clothes, because no one knows you, and no one wants to know you, because you are guilty, guilty, and you go home, thinking sadly about how New Haven has changed, and how <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> have changed since [the first time you were here](https://www.luminousairplanes.com/section/bleak-college-days/), all for the worse, it seems, and of course you can’t sleep, so you sit down at the computer and decide that somehow <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> is the time to begin the project you have been carrying around in your head [for years](https://www.luminousairplanes.com/section/for-years/), namely, to write a Commentary that will complete and bring up to date the book you wrote about your time in Thebes, and it’s long past midnight, and you’re alone in your cat-haunted room, typing, and you think <span style="font-style: italic;">you’re</span> the one who needs help! My god.

**FOR YEARS** <span style="padding-left: 355px;">(New Haven, 2006-present)</span>
&nbsp;
I.e., since the summer of 2001, when you were still writing the narrative on which you are now commenting. Even then, you had a feeling that it, the narrative, was totally inadequate to explain what had happened in Thebes in the fall of 2000, [your trip to clean out your grandparents’ house](https://www.luminousairplanes.com/section/contact-other-worlds-1) which ended in such disaster for you and Yesim and Kerem and perhaps for other people too, you didn’t know, you’d run away and Thebes was a closed book to you in more senses than one. Trying to explain what had happened in one short narrative was like trying to cover an elephant with a handkerchief. September 10, 2001 found you making notes on the <span style="font-style: italic;">second part of your project</span>, in which you would tell all the stories you’d forgotten or left out of the first part.
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">The next day you lost interest in your book, in any book. When the air smells of burning bodies, who thinks about books?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">You didn’t look at your notes again for a year. You were living in San Francisco again at that point, trying not to get too involved in the weird, dangerous protest movement which your friends Alice and Erin had joined. You were sitting cross-legged on the floor of the front room of your neighbor Robert’s apartment, irritated beyond measure by Dylan’s “Mozambique,” which Robert was playing, as per usual, at absolutely top volume, when suddenly you had the idea to diffuse the line of your project into a <a href="https://www.luminousairplanes.com/section/digital-cloud" style="cursor: alias;">digital cloud.</a> It made sense. What you were trying to cover with your explanatory handkerchief was no longer even an elephant; it was the world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">You got all excited about the idea; you researched the available software tools. Maybe you would write a text-adventure game, the way you wanted to when you were twelve years old. Maybe you’d tell your story in the form of—Gog help you!—a blog.</p>

**THE DIGITAL CLOUD** <span style="padding-left: 267px;">(New Haven, 2006-present)</span>
&nbsp; 
In retrospect, I wonder if I’m getting my dates confused, if I had the idea to write my so-called <span style="font-style: italic;">commentary</span> as a digital cloud after September 11. Clouds were all I could think about then: clouds blowing south across the water into Brooklyn, clouds of dust and documents; clouds that had been three thousand people. If the history of my time was going to be written at all, I might have thought, at that point, it would have to be written on a cloud.
