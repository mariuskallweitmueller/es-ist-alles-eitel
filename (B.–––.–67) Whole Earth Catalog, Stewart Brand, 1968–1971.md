**Intelligent Life in the Universe**
Methodically blow your mind. The information in this book, mutually massaged by the American and Soviet co-authors, proceeds from superb introductions to evolutionary astronomy and biology, through a complete presentation of recent discoveries of astronomy and space science, to brilliant speculation on the parameters of inter-civilization communication. It’s the best general astronomy book of recent years but that’s nothing next to its impact on all the biggest questions we know.

Almost any other of the many accounts of alleged contacts of human beings with the crews of flying saucers--accounts which regale the flying saucer societies--follow the same pattern and stress the same points. The extraterrestrials are human, with few even minor physical differences from local cosmetic standards. (I know of no case of Negro saucerians, or Oriental saucerians, reported in the United States; but there are very few flying saucer reports made in this country by Negroes or by Orientals.)

With 1011 stars in our Galaxy 109 other galaxies, there are at least 1020 stars in the universe. Most of them, as we shall see in subsequent chapters, may be accompanied by solar systems. If there are 1020 solar systems in the universe, and the universe is 1010 years old--and if, further, solar systems have formed roughly uniformly in time--then one solar system is formed every 10\-10 yr = 3 x 10\-3 seconds.  
On the average, a million solar systems are formed in the universe each hour.

The existence of more than one universe is impossible,  
by definition.

So, by an interesting coincidence, the distances between the stars in interstellar space, relative to their diameters, are just about the same as the distances between the atoms and molecules in interstellar space, relative to _their_ diameters. Interstellar space is as empty as a cubical building, 60 miles long, 60 miles wide, and 60 miles high, containing a single grain of sand.

Taken at face value, the legend suggests that contact occurred between human beings and a non-human civilization of immense powers on the shores of the Persian Gulf, perhaps near the site of the ancient Sumerian city of Eridu, and in the fourth millenium B.C. or earlier. There are three different but cross-referenced accounts of the Apkpliu dating from classical times.

But how can a natural satellite have such a low density? The material of which it is made must have a certain amount of rigidity, so that cohesive forces will be stronger than the gravitational tidal forces of Mars, which will tend to disrupt the satellite.  
Such rigidity would ordinarily exclude densities below about 0.1 gm cm\-3. Thus, only one possibility remains. Could Phobos be indeed rigid, on the outside—but hollow in the inside? A natural satellite cannot be a hollow object. Therefore, we are led to the possibility that Phobos—and possibly Deimos as well—may be artificial satellites of Mars.

Radio astronomers may be interested to know that the so-called "brightness temperature" of the Earth at television wavelengths is some hundreds of millions of degrees. This is 100 times greater than the radio brightness of the sun at comparable wavelengths, during a period of low sunspot activity.

▼An advanced technical civilization is trying to communicate with us. But how can we possibly understand what they are saying? They are not likely to speak English or Russian. They have had a different evolutionary history. They are on a planet with perhaps an entirely different physical environment.

The 551 zeros and ones are representations of the two varieties of signals contained in the message. The problem is to convert this sequence of 551 symbols into an intelligible message, knowing that there has been no previous communication between the transmitting and receiving civilizations.</span>
