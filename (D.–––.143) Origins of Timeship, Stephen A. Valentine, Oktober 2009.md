<b>WE HAVE LONG BEEN FASCINATED</b> by immortality, as we see for example in the Greek myths about immortal gods and mortal humans who are occasionally granted immortality. 
[[(A.–––.–13) Synopsis HDG 47, Quirke Andrews, 2018|→ (A.–––.–13) Synopsis HDG 47, Quirke Andrews, 2018]]

These tales also contain cautions, as in the story of the Cumean Sibyl who won immortality from Apollo, but neglected to stipulate that she would not age. However, for much of human history, despite thinking about immortality, we have been resigned to aging and death. As with the weather, there was little we could do about it. 
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Metaphysical immortality, the notion that an entity could never die, is outside the realm of science. But developments in science, particularly genetics, may eventually make possible extreme life extension of hundreds of years, and perhaps even practical immortality, sometimes called technological immortality, in which the body does not age, and one would die only from trauma such as an accident. Indeed it now appears that aging and death are programmed into our genes and that the new frontiers opened by DNA research may make it possible to identify the genes that cause aging and turn them off.
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">A number of scientists in the field estimate that extreme life extension may be twenty to a hundred years off. What does that mean for people today who are in their fifties or older? How might they get from this present of aging and mortality to a future of indefinite youthfulness? One answer is time travel, not in the science-fiction sense, but through cryopreservation — be cryopreserved now and reanimated after decades or centuries when one can be "reconditioned" to a healthy youthful life that will last indefinitely.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">In 1964, the physics professor Robert Ettinger published the book, <i>The Prospect of Immortality</i>, proposing that a person could be frozen immediately after legal death and reanimated at a future time when the cause of death could be cured and advanced technologies could restore the person to youthful health and could halt aging. The cryonics movement grew out of these proposals, and in 1967, the same year as the first heart transplant, Dr. James Bedford became the first person to undergo cryonic suspension. He was placed in a capsule that was developed using super insulation and high vacuum cryonic technologies that had recently been developed for the upper stages of the Saturn rocket that eventually took us to the moon.</p>

Today over one hundred people are cryopreserved at liquid nitrogen temperatures, in which state they can remain indefinitely with no deterioration. Additionally, over a thousand people are signed up for the procedure at their deaths. Reanimation of those who have been cryopreserved is not possible today, but the increasing rate of biotech and medical advances suggests that it will be someday. 
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">It is for the cryonic storage of patients, as well as to be a center for life extension research, that Timeship was conceived. Timeship will be the world's most secure and technologically advanced facility for the long-term storage of cryopreserved biological materials.Timeship will also house the most advanced laboratories doing research on every aspect of life extension, from nutritional supplements that may slow aging now, to research at the genetic level that could eventually stop and reverse aging. This research will also include all aspects of the cryopreservation process — not only the preparation of patients traveling to the future and their reanimation, but also the preparation and storage of human organs for transplantation.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 200px;">At this time most organs cannot be frozen due to the damage caused by ice crystals, so genetically matching organs must be obtained immediately after a donor dies. The vitrification process being developed for Timeship may make it possible to create banks of vitrified organs and thereby save the lives of many who today cannot find matching organs in time. This research will also include nanotechnology, which will be important for the creation of miniature robots, or "nanorobots," that will enter the body to repair damage from disease and the cryopreservation process.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Thus Timeship's mission is in two parts: life extension research and cryopreservation of patients and biological materials. To fulfill these two missions, Timeship's six-acre structure is designed to provide safety and security against multiple threats, both natural and humanmade, including terrorist attack, sea level changes due to global warming, and interruption of energy supplies. Timeship is designed to remain operational for hundreds of years.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 200px;">The exterior and interior of Timeship echo themes of security and rebirth both functionally and symbolically. The architect of Timeship, Stephen Valentine, felt that symbolism was important in the design, remarking that "architectural symbolism is a primary way for us to absorb the meanings and implications of radical change, and Timeship has the potential to change our notion of death, and thereby our notion of human life itself." Furthermore, Valentine felt that since Timeship would need to be operational for hundreds of years, it was important that its design be timeless and not just reiterate the fashions of the moment.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Why might someone want to live indefinitely? In addressing this question, we have to realize that the very under-standing of who we are as human beings has changed over time. Primitive peoples saw themselves as one with nature, and regarded death as a melting back into the earth from which they had come. Early high civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians, saw the beehive-like social group and its relationship to the order of the cosmos as primary, not the life and death of the individual. It is in the West that we see the emergence of the individual.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Today we invest in individuals, protecting and nurturing them, and providing them with educations that will enable them to become autonomous, self-actualized people, capable of pursuing their individual paths in life. We see each individual as having a unique view of the world, unique talents, and an irreplaceable "self."</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Until now we have experienced our lives as having a natural arc, with parts devoted to youth, maturity, and old age, each with their functions and desires. But recently we have begun to challenge those boundaries. For example, the function of learning, once primarily confined to youth, has spilled over into maturity and even old age, and just as we begin to fully master our disciplines we find ourselves aging. In addition, in the past one's body might have been accumulating aches and pains by the age of sixty, provoking a feeling that the time for rest might be approaching. But today many youthful sixty- and seventy-year-olds are running marathons.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Some are beginning to ask, what is the point, after all of this effort to develop one's unique individual self, of living for only a few decades? Why not further develop one's talents over centuries, and give society the opportunity to benefit from contributions we cannot yet imagine? Extreme life extension might lead to a "long view." Rather than think in terms of humankind eventually journeying to the stars, we might think in terms of someday journeying to the stars ourselves. We might not master just a narrow discipline, but a broad range of disciplines, and accomplish scientific or artistic achievements not previously possible. We might not just plant and eventually harvest vineyards, but also olive groves. And we might not just plan for the educations of our children, but also of our great-great grandchildren.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">The human race survived for millennia without the notion of the individual. But it was only with the liberation of the individual in eighteenth-century Europe and America that we saw the explosive developments of science and modern culture. Today the average person commands more wealth, knowledge, and opportunity than did the princes of the ancient world. The individuality that exists in us today existed as a potential in the past, but no one saw it. What further potentials lie in us, waiting to be released when we can extend our lives over hundreds of years?</p>
&nbsp;

##### It is the vision of these potentials that motivates those who advocate extreme life extension, who spend their resources on the research to achieve it, and who are building Timeship.
