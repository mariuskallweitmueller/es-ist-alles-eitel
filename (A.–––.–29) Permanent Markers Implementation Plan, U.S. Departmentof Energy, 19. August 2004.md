# Permanent Markers Implementation Plan,
# U.S. Department of Energy,
# 19\. August 2004
### ↓ (A.–––.–29)

**5.1 Large Surface Markers**
&nbsp;
Information related to the Large Surface Markers is provided in this section.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.1.1 Conceptual Design</span>
&nbsp;
The Large Surface Markers will be placed on the perimeter of the controlled area and on the perimeter of the repository footprint. Thirty-two markers will be on the controlled area perimeter and sixteen will be on the repository footprint.
&nbsp;
The markers will all be of the same design (Figure 3). They will consist of twoseparate stone monoliths (a lower member and an upper member) joined by amortise-and-tenon joint. The lower member will be buried and will be in the shape of a truncated pyramid. It will be 22 feet in height including the tenon. The base of the lower member will be 8 feet square; at the top of the truncated pyramid structure, it will measure 4 feet square. The tenon extending upward 5 feet from the truncated pyramid will be 2 feet square. All of the lower member will be below ground level except the tenon (17 feet of the lower member will be below grade). The upper member will be 25 feet in height and measure 4 feet by 4 feet; it will be entirely above ground level. A mortise will be cut in the lower portion of the upper member to match the tenon extending upward from the lower member.

Each Large Surface Marker will have warning messages engraved in the seven languages. The messages will be inscribed on all four sides of the upper member in the top 6-to-8 feet; this will result in messages placed 17-to-19 feet above ground level. Three of these messages will be primarily written text and one, the one facing towards the repository, will be an illustration with limited text. In addition, messages consisting primarily of written text will be inscribed on all four sides of the lower member below ground level. These messages will be located about 5-to-12 feet above the bottom of the lower member. The messages on the controlled area perimeter markers will differ from those on the repository footprint. The messages that will be engraved on the markers on the controlled area perimeter are shown in Figure 4, and those that will be on the markers placed on the repository footprint are shown in Figure 5. Additional detail regarding these messages is provided in Section 6.0.

Additional details for the Large Surface Markers conceptual design are as follows.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
##### 1. The upper and lower members will be constructed of granite.
##### 2. The surfaces of the markers will be polished to remove all loose material and indentations.
##### 3. The lower member will weigh 65 tons.
##### 4. The upper member will weigh 40 tons.
##### 5. The calculated center of gravity of the two members will be 15.5 feet above the bottom of the lower member.
##### [...]
&nbsp;
**5.2 Small Subsurface Markers**
&nbsp;
Information related to the Small Subsurface Markers is provided in this section.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.2.1 Conceptual Design</span>
&nbsp;
Small Subsurface Markers will be buried throughout the repository footprint, within the Berm, and in the four shaft seals. Spacing between these Small Subsurface Markers will be between 15 to 40 feet and random within that range, resulting in the emplacement of several thousand markers. Random spacing will preclude souvenir hunters from identifying a burial pattern, making it difficult to intentionally excavate and retrieve a large number of the markers.
&nbsp;
The markers will be buried at selected depths between 2 and 6 feet and random depths within this range. This range of depths was selected for two reasons:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
##### 1\. Soil covering the caliche in the local WIPP area ranges to a depth of 10 feet.
&nbsp;
##### 2\. In preparing for drilling, local service companies typically excavate an area of about 260 feet by 300 feet. In addition, an area of approximately 150 by 150 feet is excavated to a depth of 4 to 6 feet to create a drilling mud pit. Also, a cellar is excavated to about 6 feet to accommodate the drill rig.
&nbsp;
Thus, by burying the Small Subsurface Markers above the caliche and below the surface at random intervals over a range of shallow depths, a large number of the markers will be available for discovery during the process of excavating and preparing the drill site. This provides a reasonable likelihood that at least some of the markers will be discovered by the site-preparation crew.
&nbsp;
The proposed design for the Small Subsurface Markers is a disk with a 9-inch diameter. The conceptual design is to fabricate the disks using a variety of different materials (CCA suggests 3) to lend redundancy to the system. Each marker will have a warning message in one of the seven languages used on the Large Surface Markers, the Buried Storage Rooms, and the Information Center. Equal numbers of markers in individual languages will be distributed. The Level II Message to be engraved on the markers is shown in Figure 6. [...]
&nbsp;
**5.3 Berm**
&nbsp;
As noted previously, the Berm’s presence inherently conveys a Level I message that something manmade is present. No higher level messages are communicated by the Berm. The Buried Storage Room that will be constructed inside the Berm (along with another Buried Storage Room located to the north of the Berm) will, however, contain messages of greater complexity (i.e., Levels II, III, and IV messages). The Buried Storage Rooms are discussed in subsection 5.4. Magnets and radar reflectors will also be buried in the Berm.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.3.1 Constructed Berm</span>
&nbsp;
The conceptual design of the constructed Berm, open design considerations and alternative materials are described in this section.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.3.1.1 Conceptual Design</span>
&nbsp;
The Berm will be rectangular in plan, covering the footprint of the waste disposal area of the repository on the ground surface plus a small margin; it is not to exceed the area of the repository footprint by more than 10 percent. As planned in the conceptual design, the rectangular footprint of the disposal area measures 2063 by 2545 feet; the inner perimeter of the Berm measures 2165 by 2670 feet, so this plan incorporates a 51 foot margin between the repository outline and the Berm on the shorter (north and south) sides and a 62 foot margin on the longer (east and west) sides. Since the Berm is 98 feet wide, the outer perimeter of the Berm measures 2363 feet by 2868 feet (see Figure 6).

[[(A.–34.–––) Zentraler Monumentenplatz, Human Interference Task Force, Mai 1984.png|→ (A.–34.–––) Zentraler Monumentenplatz, Human Interference Task Force, Mai 1984]]
The cross-sectional dimensions of the Berm conceptual design is shown in Figure 10. As currently specified, the Berm’s minimum base is 98 feet, with a minimum height above ground of 33 feet. It will extend 10 feet below ground. The salt core is pyramidal in shape, and approximately 30 feet in height. The caliche layer covering the salt core is approximately 5-7 feet thick; the rip-rap covering the caliche is approximately 3-5 feet thick. The slope will be at least 1.3 horizontal to 1.0 vertical.
&nbsp;
The design of the Berm will incorporate drainage outlets at intervals of approximately 328 feet to prevent ponding. These outlets will consist of rip-rap filled trenches 10 feet deep and 6.5 feet wide, extending through the Berm base below the surface. The Berm will have a concrete or granite stairway to the top and down the opposite side, centered on the west side of the Berm. [...]
&nbsp;
**5.4 Buried Storage Rooms**
&nbsp;
Information regarding the Buried Storage Rooms is provided in this section.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.4.1 Conceptual Design</span>
&nbsp;
There will be two Buried Storage Rooms: one buried at grade level inside the Berm; and the second buried 20 feet below the surface, 525 feet north of the Berm on a line passing through the Information Center, the center of the northern and southern sections of the Berm, and the Hot Cell.
&nbsp;
The room dimensions are the same for the two rooms: 39 feet long, by 22 feet wide, by 16 feet high (Figure 9). The walls of the rooms will consist of granite slabs joined only at the perimeter locations. Seven interior granite panels will be contained in each room. The walls and interior panels will be inscribed with Level IV messages (Figure 10).  
The text of the messages in English is in CCA Appendix PIC, Appendix C. Pictographs to be engraved in the panels will also include those used on the Small Subsurface Markers (Figure 6) and the Large Surface Markers (Figures 4 and 5). The conceptual design includes two optional materials for the floor and ceiling of the rooms: granite or concrete.
&nbsp;
The only entrance to each room will consist of a single tapered hole in one wall measuring 2 feet at the inner minimum diameter (Figure 9). A plug will be inserted into the hole. The plug will weigh approximately 1600 pounds, so that its removal will require more than one individual or the use of machinery or explosives. The relatively small size of the opening will inhibit the removal of anything from the room. The combined weight of the walls, panels, floor and ceiling of the rooms will be approximately 600 tons. [...]
&nbsp;
**5.5 Hot Cell**
&nbsp;
The Hot Cell has already been constructed; it is intended to remain on site as an “archeological remnant,” thus serving as a “de facto” permanent marker. Current plans are to use the below-grade portion of the building for cask-to-cask transfer of RH waste from “road” casks to “facility” casks. It is not currently known whether the building will be radioactively contaminated. If it is, it will be decontaminated during closure to the same standards as other WIPP facilities.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.5.1 Conceptual Design</span>
&nbsp;
The Hot Cell is a reinforced concrete structure measuring 70 by 40 feet, with walls 4.5 feet thick. The Hot Cell foundation extends approximately 30 feet below grade, and the roof is 60 feet above grade. A floor separates the below-grade section from the above-grade section. [...]
&nbsp;
**5.6 Information Center**
&nbsp;
Information related to the Information Center is provided in this section.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">5.6.1 Conceptual Design</span>
&nbsp;
The Information Center will be located above ground at the geometric center of the repository footprint. The site will be graded for drainage away from the Information Center. Overall dimensions of the structure will be 40 by 32 by 10 feet (Figure 11). The conceptual design is an open structure, allowing observation of the contents of the building with natural light. It will consist of walls, floor, and panels made of granite. The walls will be buried to five feet in compacted caliche to provide support for the building.

The same Level IV messages that appear in the Buried Storage Rooms will appear on the Information Center. It will also contain information regarding the location of the Buried Storage Room in the Controlled Area. The primary function of this additional message is to caution humans not to excavate this Buried Storage Room but to leave it untouched for future generations in the event that the information in the Information Center is no longer readable.
