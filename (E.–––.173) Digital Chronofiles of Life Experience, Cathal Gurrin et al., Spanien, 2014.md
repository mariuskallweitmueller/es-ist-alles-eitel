Earlier societies have left legacies informing us of their actions. Society has a need to record and document its events and has used whatever means possible. From Newgrange,

Stonehenge and the Pyramids in Egypt, to the headstones on Easter Island, we are left with clues from a distant society. In many ways these societies created durable objects that tell a story that transcends time and sometimes these legacies leave us with a mystery to be solved in modern times. Historically the interaction and communication between individuals bore witness to events, and such material is today studied by historians and archivists. Whether stone carvings, exchange of letters, recorded phone calls, or the eyewitness details, this is what leaves the historical trace and forms the basis of the historical record.

<p style="text-indent: 200px;">As technology evolved, so too have the recording tools; hammer and stone, pen and paper, have been replaced by computers and digital recording devices. The ease at which we can create the historical trace is ever increasing and our ability to create an <i>evidence of me</i> has no bounds. Continual advancement in sensing technologies has lead us this point at which it becomes possible, should one wish, to continually record all of life activities into a personal media-rich archive, or as we refer to it in this paper, a <i>personal chronofile</i>. This process is called lifelogging and can quickly generate terabytes of information about the individual, in particular using wearable sensors and cameras, which are alreadyourishing on the consumer market [7].</p>
<p style="text-indent: 200px;">Compare this to the most detailed life chronicle from the past, the Dymaxion Chronofile [18] where Richard Buckminster-Fuller documented his activities in detail day-by-day into a lifetime archive. Buckminster-Fuller referred to his archive as a “very accurate record of a human beingˮ, consisting of 140,000 papers and 1,700 hours of audio and video. It is our conjecture that as lifelogging becomes a normative activity, archivists will have access to rich and unimaginably detailed records of many such individuals, not just those with the time or resources to manually curate a lifetime archive. These chronofiles would provide a first-hand, non-interpreted account of the past from people whose lifelogs provide a direct connection to historical activities and events.</p>
