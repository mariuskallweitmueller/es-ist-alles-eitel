# Basic Usenet Terminology,

### ↙ (B.––1.–––)
Like most communities, USENET has its own language. Some of the terms used have meaning unique to USENET. Here are definitions for a few of the more basic ones.

<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 113px;">**Acronyms**</span> USENET is full of acronyms. Acronyms _save band-width._ (Taking up a lot of bandwidth is the network equivalent of personally taking up a lot of room on a crowded bus or train. It is discouraged.) Here are some of the more common acronyms. These are ones you may see in any newsgroup.
&nbsp;
**Common Acronyms**

Appendix A contains a copy of an article that is periodically posting to the “news.announce.newusers” newsgroup titled “Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about USENET. It has many more of these tidbits and a lot of other useful information.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 145px;">**Article**</span> An article is a USENET conversation element. It is a computer file that contains a question or piece of information made available to the USENET community by posting to a newsgroup.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 150px;">**FAQs**</span> A FAQ is a file that contains the answers to a newsgroup’s frequently asked questions. It may also contain other information of interest to a newsgroup’s audience. FAQs are very important. FAQs reflect the self worth of a newsgroup. If a newsgroup has a well developed and maintained set of FAQs, the newsgroup participants take their subject matter seriously. FAQs (the substantial ones) are effort intensive to develop and time consuming to maintain.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 135px;">**Flames**</span> A flame is a heated, emotionally packed, reply to an ar-ticle. Flames can get personally insulting and quite nasty. A flame can contain explicit obscenities and A LOT OF SHOUTING!!!. The participants of newsgroups that have been around a while know what topics will result in flames and try to avoid them (not because they want to remain civil, though some do, but because they have seen it all before).
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 110px;">**Hierarchy**</span> A hierarchy is a group of things arranged in order of rank. A USENET newsgroup hierarchy refers to the set of all newsgroups contained within a specific broad subject category.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 150px;">**Index**</span> An index is a numbered list of articles and replies.  
It is what a news reader presents its user with.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 140px;">**Lurker**</span> A lurker is a person who regularly reads the articles as-sociated with a particular newsgroup but seldom participates.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 105px;">**Moderator**</span> A moderator is a person who controls what gets posted to a particular newsgroup. A moderator is used to ensure that a newsgroup’s articles stick to the agreed upon subject matter. A newsgroup may or may not have a moderator.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 100px;">**Newsgroup**</span> A USENET newsgroup is a place of people to have con-versations about a well-defined topic. Physically it is made of the computer files that contain the conversation elements to the discussions currently in progress about the agreed upon topic.

<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 80px;">**News Reader**</span> A news reader is a program that organizes the conversa-tion elements in a sensible and presentable manner. The newsreader allows the person using it to read and/or participate in those conversations.

<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 125px;">**Posting**</span> Posting is the act of making an article or reply available to a newsgroup for distribution. It is done through a newsreader.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 145px;">**Reply**</span> A reply is also a USENET conversation element. It dif-fers from an article in that it refers to a previously posted article.
&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; padding-right: 130px;">**Spoiler**</span> Spoiler When the word ‘‘spoiler” appears in an article’s subjectline it indicates that the body of the article may contain more information about a movie, book, television show, etc. than some people want to know before actually experiencing the event. A spoiler warning is usually attached to the review of such an event.
&nbsp;
Some topics are subject to prolonged discussion. This branch of USENET is the place for just such topics. Philosophy, politics and religion are just a few of the topics you will find in here.
