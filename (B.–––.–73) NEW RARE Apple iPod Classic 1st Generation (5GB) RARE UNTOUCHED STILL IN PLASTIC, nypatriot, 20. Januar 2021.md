##### **About this product**
Once the Apple iPod Classic 1st Generation was introduced, music storage and portability were changed forever. This classic device can store up to 5 GB worth of MP3 files, meaning it has a maximum storage capacity of about 1,000 songs.

#### The 2-inch monochrome LCD display screen is easy to read and shows both the song title and artist of the song currently playing. Users are able to quickly and easily navigate through their playlists, songs, and artists using the iPod’s scroll wheel, center button, and auxiliary button. Add in an impressive 10-hour battery life and iTunes compatibility, and it is no wonder why iPod is the most popular music player on the market.
&nbsp;

#### ALL SERIOUS OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED
&nbsp;
#### NEW IN ORIGINAL BOX - NEVER USED - ALL ACCESSORIES AND IPOD SEALED IN FACTORY PLASTIC. DOCUMENTATION AND CD PACKET ARE STILL FACTORY SEALED AS WELL. ITEM SAT ON DISPLAY IN MY OFFICE APPLE MUSEUM FOR YEARS IN A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED DISPLAY CASE WITH UV PROTECTION. THIS IS TRULY A COLLECTORS ITEM AND REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL ICONS OF CHANGE AND THE NEW MILLENNIUM. A LESSER QUALITY VERSION SITS IN THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN NYC.
&nbsp;
#### TO ANSWER A COMMON QUESTION - I HAVE NOT SOLD 2 OF THESE PREVIOUSLY, THE COUNT IS WRONG. THE TWO SALES SHOWN WERE NOT COMPLETED DUE TO BUYERS NOT PAYING FOR THE ITEM, ONE CHANGED THEIR MIND THE OTHER DID NOT WISH TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION, SO WHEN RELISTED, THE COUNT REMAINS AS THOUGH THERE WERE TWO SOLD. PLEASE CONTACT EBAY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I AM SURE THEY CAN VERIFY THIS FOR YOU.
&nbsp;
#### THERE IS NO ORIGINAL RECEIPT. ALSO NOTE THE SERIAL NUMBER ON THE IPOD MATCHES THE SERIAL ON THE BOX, SO IT WAS NOT AN ITEM PUT TOGETHER FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES. EVERYTHING IS ORIGINAL .
&nbsp;
#### I HAVE NO IDEA IF THE BATTERY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AS IT WAS NEVER TURNED ON OR CHARGED. IT IS STILL IN ITS „DON‘T STEAL MUSIC“ PLASTIC WRAP.
